# pybank_management_project
A simple command-line based Bank Account Management System built using Python. This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as file handling, JSON data storage, authentication, and modular functions.

It allows users to create accounts, securely access them using a PIN, and perform basic banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.
Concepts Used

This project helped reinforce important Python fundamentals:
*File Handling
*JSON for data persistence
*Dictionaries for account storage
*Functions for modular code
*Conditional statements
*Loops(while)
*Basic authentication logic
*os module to check file existence
